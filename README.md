# sqlalchemy-challenge

## Overview

This repo contains a directory called "SurfsUp" in which there is an climate.ipynb file analyzing precipitation and temperature data in Hawaii from August 2016 - August 2017 using SQLAlchemy. There is also an app.py file with the same analysis using Flask to present the findings in JSON format in a web application.
